predrovgs is no longer maintaining DraggablePanel

Due to this issue https://github.com/pedrovgs/DraggablePanel/issues/123 I couldn't use the library and it's really cool, so as suggested in that issue by the OP, I have removed the dependency on NineOldAndroids  



FYI-
I don't intend to maintain this, I'm just making a debug app and I wanted to show off in work

 [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/systemecks/system-ecks/sk-DraggablePanel/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/systemecks/system-ecks/sk-DraggablePanel/_latestVersion) 
 
 ```compile 'com.github.saikcaskey:sk-draggable-panel:1.0' ```
